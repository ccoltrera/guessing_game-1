This game asks the user to guess how many countries I have visited. If the user provides something other than a number, they are prompted again to provide a number. It then compares the number the user provided with the answer and returns a message whether the user is correct, too high or too low.

If the user guesses the correct number of countries visited, the user is then prompted to guess the name of a country that I have visted. The user is then notified if they are correct again or if they are incorrect.
